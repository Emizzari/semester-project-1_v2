      We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but
      brought to live through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000
      different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore.
      Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and
      play around to see science come to life (apart from the dinosaur
      exhibits – they only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).">

            Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’,
            explores the night sky and what we can see and know about the universe around us.
            We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a
            bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.

          <p class="main__section__p">
            For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our
            origins. Where do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his
            theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and understanding our
            place in this world.
          </p>
          <p class="main__section__p">
            Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today
            have evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures
            who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of
            dinosaurs too.

          <h2 class="main__section__h2">ECOLOGY</h2>
          <p class="main__section__p">
            As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet,
            the more important it becomes that scientists explore how to create a
            sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole planet.
          </p>
          <p class="main__section__p">
            In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently
            face including global warming, extinction of species, and pollution. But
            we also focus on the positive ways we can all contribute to a brighter future.

          <p class="main__section__p">
            The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial intelligence
            are the science of the future. From useful home applications of AI to
            industrial uses of robotics, the future is here. You can even say hello
            and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.

          <p class="main__section__p">
            From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are
            offering us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny world.
          </p>
          <p class="main__section__p">
            For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of
            life much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine.
            Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a
            look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and
            the first heart transplant.
          </p>
          <p class="main__section__p">
            Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab,
            but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures
            have beat us to it.
